From the start, Tiat had known that the other girl was extremely strong.

Of course, they had always traded blows evenly during training sessions, but there were two simple reasons for this. Firstly, those were practice fights to help each other improve, so there was no way she would’ve gone all-out to obliterate her enemy. The second reason lay in the girl’s personality, which was completely incompatible with the talent she possessed. Lakhesh Nyx Seniorious was a kind, gentle, and meek girl who always put her friends before herself.

Naturally, after Lakhesh had cast off those two shackles, she’d become a powerful weapon that far surpassed her usual self; one that Tiat Siba Ignareo could never hope to match up to.

Once, twice. In her mind’s eye, every time their blades clashed, she was thoroughly, helplessly outmatched. She was unable to perfectly parry her enemy’s attack, and the pressure exerted by Lakhesh’s venenum was on a whole other level from hers. The fundamental difference in strength between them was so overwhelming that it ignored anything Tiat could’ve used to tip the scales in her favor, whether it be her swordsmanship, physique or weight.

“La…”

<em>Why, Lakhesh?</em> Tiat had wanted to ask that, but she had found it difficult to breathe properly, let alone speak. Her teeth were clenched so hard she couldn’t even open her mouth to form words. If she didn’t completely focus on the “enemy” in front of her, her legs might’ve given way then and there.

What’s more, she soon reached her limits. Lakhesh had effortlessly swung Seniorious at her, but she hadn’t dodged in time, instead raising Ignareo for a half-hearted parry—but the explosive force behind the sword was too much to bear, and Tiat had been sent flying like a pebble struck by a club.

<em>Ahhh…</em> The world spun chaotically, and myriad thoughts swirled around Tiat’s head as she cannonballed through the air. She felt sorrow at crossing blades with her precious family member; joy at seeing the recovered Lakhesh, no matter what state she was in now; anger at her inexplicable decision to stand by Feodor’s side, and shame at being helplessly tossed through the air while she was mired in such a troublesome predicament.

<em>Not good. It’ll be dangerous if I hit a tree.</em> Shoving the countless broken pieces of her heart aside, Tiat shook off her tears, steeled herself and prepared to adjust her trajectory—

<em>Thump.</em> Something felt soft yet strong… She was being cradled in someone’s arms all of a sudden.

“Eh?” Not understanding what had just happened, her train of thought froze.

“You did well.” A gentle, familiar voice brushed past Tiat’s ears.

<em>Wha… Huh?</em> That unbearably nostalgic voice had been Tiat’s favorite, and she would often find herself listening to it while looking up at the voice with adoration in her eyes. Yet she couldn’t possibly have heard it, because it was now lost to her forever.

Tiat raised her head to get a better look at the person’s face. However, she’d pushed herself too hard during the fight and her body wasn’t doing what she told it to. Still unmoving, she stared straight ahead as Lakhesh calmly walked closer.

“Is it you? Chtho…”

<em>Why don’t us faeries have eyes at the back of our heads?</em> Tiat tried her utmost to crane her stiffened neck and swivel her eyes upward, but she still could not see hide nor hair of the other person.

“Yep.” That voice rang in her ears once more, affirming her suspicions.

“But why…”

“I couldn’t leave you guys behind, so I came back. And—” Behind Tiat, a slender finger reached out to point forward. “It’s not just me. See?”

Somewhere in front, another person appeared and placed themselves firmly between the two girls.

“Hey. Lakhesh, Tiat. Long time no see.” All Tiat could glimpse was the silhouette and side profile of a tall man. It was a face she really, really… <em>No, only somewhat</em>—missed, and liked, and found a bit dependable. All the same, it was the face of another person she never should’ve seen again.

“C’mon, it’s only been a while, but you two are already at this height, huh. Good grief, puberty really is scary.” His tone was relaxed. Folding his arms, he nodded his head and turned to face Lakhesh.

“Wh…who the hell are you?” the confused girl shouted in alarm at the two unexpected arrivals. Unfazed, the man stepped briskly toward her.

<em>Watch out!</em> At present, Lakhesh was no longer the kind, gentle girl they had been familiar with. Her whole personality had changed, and she’d been led astray by that villain. <em>She’s in her rebellious phase, and she’ll destroy anything she touches! Not to mention, she’s got that ultra dangerous, super powerful dug weapon too!</em> But, the two who should have never been here, who by all accounts had perished five years ago, didn’t know that.

Unsurprisingly, when Lakhesh recovered from her momentary shock, she immediately raised Seniorious and swung it at the man without hesitation—

“Huh?”

Only the whistling wind could be heard as the blade sliced through thin air.

“Wha?” Forgetting herself, Tiat let out a muted scream. She was sure the attack was a lethal one; there was practically no way to avoid it at such close quarters. At least, if it were her, she might not even have realized until her head was sent flying. But…

“Ha-ha-ha! You’re still as lively as ever, eh? That’s great!” Somehow, the man had dodged Lakhesh’s attack and was now standing behind her. “Yep, that’s an excellent swing. No hesitation at all. If you keep wielding Seniorious like that, you’d be practically invincible… However—”

Laughing theatrically, the man pointed one unwavering finger at Lakhesh. “A father’s love isn’t so easily broken!”

<em>What in the world is he saying?</em> Tiat was utterly dumbfounded by this unexpected development.

“Now come, Lakhesh! This body of mine might be weary and beaten, but it’s more than enough to endure one or two of your pubescent outbursts! Let’s have a father-daughter heart-to-heart with our fists!”

“The hell are you on about?” Once more, Lakhesh was confused and appeared to be on the verge of tears.

Without a care, the man leaped toward her, arms outstretched, as if he were trying to give her a hug. “Take this! Secret Emnetwiht Art: Ultimate Shattering Fist of Fatherly Love!”

<em>What kind of name</em> is <em>that? And what, pray tell, are we trying to shatter here?</em>

“Wait wait wait, what’s up with your joints!?” With shock, Tiat watched the man’s entire body twist in ways that shouldn’t have been possible for any living creature.

“Ah-ha-ha-hah! There’s no escape, my daughter! Watch this!”

<em>What?! He’s flying.</em>

“Nooooooo! You disgusting, vile… Stop twisting about, you freak…!” It really was nauseating to watch, and even more unacceptable from a physiological standpoint.

“Familial bonds can simply go past the bounds of physics and common sense! Come on, open your heart and let love embrace you!”

<em>What nonsense has this guy been spouting all this time?</em>

“There’s no way familial bonds are like that! You can’t just throw common sense out the window!” Somehow, Tiat thought that Lakhesh had briefly returned to her former self with that desperate scream.

<em>This is absurd. What’s with all this? What’s going on?</em> The scene was unfolding before Tiat’s very eyes, but she couldn’t understand a single bit of it. She tried racking her brain, but still drew a blank. All she could do was stare helplessly, mouth wide open…

And then she woke up. After a slight pause, she slowly sat up, rumpled her frizzy hair, and peered at the curtains, where the first rays of dawn were beginning to leak in. Lightly rubbing her swollen eyes, she gave a great yawn.

Tiat stared at the ethereal dawnlight for a good long while.

“What the hell was that dream all about?” she screamed quietly, afraid of waking up her roommates. Mustering all her strength, she cradled her head in her hands.
